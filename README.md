# OUTBRAIK

This was our proposal for the Quantum Black challenge in the [Hello World Hackathon 2020](https://www.facebook.com/hackhelloworld/). For this we had to use Quantum Black's [kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to set up a pipeline for a machine learning project.

The idea of our project was whether we could determine if an airborne epidemic could become a pandemic. Due to limited time and lack of availability ofdata online, we prepared our own dataset. As this dataset was small, we used a small bayesian neural network to avoid overfitting.

Our project was the runner-up for this challenge.
